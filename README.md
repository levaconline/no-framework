# no-framework

No-framework is based on demos from other repositories.
It is the simplest version of a semi-framework focused on PHP knowledge instead of learning languages". So, it is just base for testing as demo my other classes/repositories. So you can include only what you need (opposite to most famous frameworks like Laravel, CakePHP, etc.wuoch have included things wkich most small business sits
Newer uses.

Since it is just a base for demos, it doesn't need a composer, docker or any additional tool. It can work on servers that do not allow you to have a composer. Usually dedicated to local people (wamp, lamp or your custom setup server, e.g. nginx), practice how to use my other classes.

# Quote
"If you want a thing done well, do it yourself."
Napoleon Bonaparte

# Requirements
- PHP8+
- Mariadb/Mysql (not obligatory)
- Any server

# Usage
- Development/testing PHP app on ISP without support for git, composer, etc.
- Can be used as a dev framework for birth: CMS.
- Not dedicated to big servers which need overpriced services.  
- Simply put a library in dir app/library and use it when
You need use #include <iostream> in framework models, class or whatever you need.
- This is intended solely for experimenting and testing your programming experience and testing innovative approaches to programming (not system administration - DevOps). Other repositories will be made which also include DevOps not supported on Sheap ISP.

# Knowledge needed
- Only PHP & MySQL (no need to know things that do not use small sites/businesses like Microservices, CI, Kubernetes, etc. So, you don't need to be a System Administrator & programmer in one).

# Note
- This semi framework has no any design. It is a simple "engine". If you wish for some template, you can find it on the web for free or make your own.

# How to install
Steps:
1. git clone reposition somewhere on your computer
2. Uplad the source of cloned dir to your project (on server - when ISP does not support gt clone or in your new local project dir). IMPORTANT: Copy only source of dir no-framework not dir.
3. Put values in config files and check the result in your browser. You should see the button which sends you to GitHub and message "Hi there".
4. In the Basic menu you can find tools. Using it, You can automatically create new you: controller, model, view.
5. If you wish to try being lucky with webdesign, of your layout and use it instead of a default one. Same for pages.
5. That should be all. The rest of things are up to you. This is just a simple structured environment. Provide only benchmark connection to DB if you need. All other things are up to you. Write class. Put it into an app/library and use it where you wish.

# Purpose
Let's be program again instead of "a secretary who uses Word" other libraries and wasting time learning how those librariesaries work. If we know PHP, why do we need to learn Jomla or WordPress? We can create our own classes. We don't need to depend on other people's libraries (which someone can always stop maintaining, putting ours in trouble).
So, the purpose is to make programmers be programmers again instead of users of other programs.

# This is not agile programming (but it can be if you prefer)
Agile programming has advantages and disadvantages (like anything).
IMO.
- Advantage is quickly job done.
- disadvantage is job quickly done means a buggy job done.
Explanation:
(This is most noticeable in the gaming industry. Many in the gaming community believe that there are no longer any good games like the ones that used to be made.)
Why is not Benetta far behind Skyrim or Fallout? Simple: The second game is made in an agile manner (take money asap regardless of low product quality). The first one was made without a stopwatch above your head and made with programmers in their job.
This is a difference between the agile programming model and other models like the "Waterfall model", "Exploratory Programming", etc.
If a programmer has no time to add "Easter Eggs" to his job, he loses creativity and becomes a machine (similar to the AI source generated).

# Benefits
- You will learn how to do new things by yourself regardless whether better or worse. You will make mistakes, but will be yours, not others. So, you can learn from mistakes (and fix them quickly) instead of crushing your project' by others mistakes and' rely on them to fix their bugs if you use them.
Let programers again to enjoy their job and it would be benefits to all (users, companies and programmers). The products will be of much better quality.
- Do what you wish/need without paying for expensive services (it works even on the cheapest ISP is anything more than PHP, MySQL (MariaDB)).

# Advice
Keep it simple. Keep it clean. Nothing new was invented by agile methodology. So, be creative instead of agile and enjoy your job.

Prepare yourself to program on your own because mainstream programming is becoming too expansive even for programmers itself. Finally, AI (not cheap) is going to replace most programmers.
