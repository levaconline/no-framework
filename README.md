# no-framework

no-framework is base for demos from other repositories. Let's say ti is just playground for php classes/aproaches and ideas.
It is simplest version of semi-framework focused on PHP knowledge instead on learning new "framework language". This was one many years old and nowadays abandoned project hidden from public visibility. So, now it is out of date and can be used only just base for testing as demo my other classes/repositories.

Since it is just base for demos, it no need composer, docker or any aditinal tool. It can work on servers that not allow you to have composer. Usually dedicated for local (wamp, lamp or your custom setup server e.g. nginx) practice how to use my other classes.

# Quote
"If you want a thing done well, do it yourself."
Napoleon Bonaparte 

# Requirements
- PHP8+
- Mariadb/Mysql (not obligatory)
- Any server

# Usage
- Development/testing php app on ISP without support git, composer, etc.
- Can be used as dev framework for bith: CMS.
- Not dedicated for big servers which needs composer/vendor. 
- Simple put library in dir app/library and use it when 
you need as you using #include <iostream> in feamework models, class or whatewer you need.

# Note
- This semiframework have no any desing. It is simple "engine". If you wish some template, you can dind it on web for free. 

# How to install
Steps:
1. git clone repositoriun somewhere on your computer
2. Uplad source of cloned dir to your project (on server - when ISP not support gt clone or in your new local project dir). IMPORTANT: Copy pnly source of dir no-framework not dir.
3. Put values in config files and check result in your browser. You should see: button which shnd you to github and message "Hi there".
4. In Basic menu you can find tool. Using it You can automatically create new section: controller, model, view. 
5. If you wish to try lucky with webdesing, make your layout and use it instead default one. Same for pages.
5. That should be all. Rest of things are up to you. This is just simple structired environment. Provide onlu banchmark connection to DB if you need. All other things are up to you. Write class. Put it to app/labrarry and use where you wish.

# Purpose
Let's be again programmers instead "a secretary who uses Word." using others libraries and waste time learning how rhose librarries works. Iw we know PHP why we need to learn Jomla or Wordpress? We can create own clases. We don't need to depend on other people's libraries (Which someone can always stop maintaining, putting ours in trouble). 
So, purpose is to make programmers to be programmers again instead users of other's programs. 

# This is not agile programming (but can be if you prefer)
Agile programming have adventages and disadventages (as anything).
IMO. 
- Adventage is quickly job done.
- Main disadventage is quickly job done often mean buggy job done. 
Explanation:
(This is most noticeable in the gaming industry. Many in the gaming community believe that there are no longer any good games like the ones that used to be made.)
Why Bethesda's Starfield is far behind Skyrim ot Fallout? Simple: Second game is made in agile maner (take money asap regardless of low product quality) first one was made Without a stopwatch above your head and made with programmers Jou in their job.
This is difference between agile programming model and other models like: "Waterfall model", "Exploratory Programming", etc.

# Benefits
- You will learn how to do new things by yourseld regardless better or worse. You will make mistakes but mistakes would be yours not others. So, you can learn from mistakes (and fix it quickly) instead crushing your project by others mistakes and relay on them to fix their bug if you use it.
Let again programmer to enjou their job and benefit would be to all (users, companies and programmers). The products will be of much better quality.

# Advice
Keep it simple. Keep it clean. Nothing new was invented by agile methodolohy. So, be creative instead agile and enjpu your job.
